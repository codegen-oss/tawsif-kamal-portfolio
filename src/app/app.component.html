    <p class="about-me">
      Back in 2012, I decided to try my hand at creating custom Tumblr themes
      and tumbled head first into the rabbit hole of coding and web development.
      Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of building software for
      an advertising agency, a start-up, a student-led design studio, and a huge
      corporation. My main focus these days is building products and leading
      projects for our clients at Upstatement. In my free time I've also
      released an online video course that covers everything you need to know to
      build a web app with the Spotify API. When I’m not at the computer, I’m
      usually rock climbing, hanging out with my wife and two cats, or running
      around Hyrule searching for Korok seeds K o r o k s e e d s .
